# Supermarket Sales Analysis and Prediction App

This project is an end-to-end **data analysis and machine learning application** for predicting supermarket sales performance and visualizing key business metrics. It includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and a Streamlit dashboard** for user interaction and prediction.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Supermarket_Sales.git
   cd Supermarket_Sales
````

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate    # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure `.env` file exists for environment variables (optional).

## Running the Streamlit App

To launch the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app allows you to input customer and transaction details, visualize sales metrics, and predict potential sales values.

---

## Model Training

To retrain the model on new data:

```bash
python Supermarket_sales/model_training.py
```

This script handles:

* Feature engineering
* Model training and evaluation
* Saving the trained model to `models/`

---

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.10+
* pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
* plotly, matplotlib, seaborn
* streamlit
* loguru, tqdm, dotenv
