# 🛒 Supermarket Sales Forecasting System

**Real-Time Machine Learning Pipeline for Sales Prediction**

This project builds an end-to-end system that predicts daily sales for a supermarket chain using machine learning and live data streaming. It features a production-ready ML pipeline, a Django API, and a Streamlit dashboard for real-time sales monitoring.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Supermarkets face challenges forecasting product-level sales due to changing customer behavior, promotions, and holidays. Most rely on historical reporting rather than predictive analytics.

> **Goal:** Build a system to predict next-day product sales per store using historical data, calendar events, weather (optional), and real-time transactions.
